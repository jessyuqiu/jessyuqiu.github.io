# About Me
-------------------------------------------
- I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [economics](https://econ.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). Prior to Pitt, I obtained my B.A. in economics and B.S. in mathematics at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My CV is [here](/assets/pdfs/CV.pdf). My email address is [yuq23{at}pitt.edu](mailto:yuq23@pitt.edu).

- My research interests lie in development economics, labor economics, and political economy.

           This paper studies how city governments in China use construction job creation to address the mid-2010s export slowdown, which significantly reduced manufacturing employment, and explores its longer-term effects. I document that cities more exposed to the export slowdown experienced an increase in construction employment. This effect is particularly prominent in cities under leaders with stronger career incentives, as construction employment creation is associated with higher promotion probabilities. One mechanism to create construction projects is through government land sales: (i) residential and commercial land sales bring real estate projects, and (ii) land sales revenue finance infrastructure projects. However, in the longer term, this land sales strategy is associated with housing oversupply and higher real estate risks.

           Contemporary public discourse often raises concerns that migration may threaten social stability, fueling support for exclusionary integration policies. We study this issue by estimating the causal effect of China's recent reform of its internal migration institutions on labor unrest (e.g., strikes). Exploiting variation from the reform's population-based discontinuity rule, we find that the reform significantly reduced labor unrest. A key mechanism is migrants' enhanced settlement intentions: to secure the opportunity of settlement offered by the reform, migrants have weaker incentives to engage in unrest. We show that the reform increased the likelihood of migrants remaining in migration destinations, and through a novel causal mediation analysis, we find that enhanced settlement intentions can explain 63 percent of the reform's effect on labor unrest. Moreover, the reform's effect on labor unrest is more pronounced in places where migrants live closer to their origins or are culturally similar to natives, making them more inclined to stay once the reform lowers institutional integration barriers. We find no evidence that the reform changed migrant composition, significantly improved migrants’ wellbeing, or prompted governments to tighten social control.

    This paper examines the impacts of siblings on people's social preference, risk attitude and time preference with a data set from a large-scale lab experiment. Employing the variation of fine rates under One-Child Policy for excess birth in different regions as instrument to address the endogeneity of whether having siblings, we find that sibling's role mainly focuses on shaping people's social preference that subjects with siblings demand less as responders in ultimatum game and behave more cooperatively in sequential prisoner's dilemma. This conclusion survives through several robustness checks. Our further result suggests that more sibling interactions and less parental expectations are two potential mechanisms through which siblings play a role in making people more prosocial. Our findings point to a positive externality along with Two-Child Policy which is widely neglected in both policy evaluation and relevant theory such as quantity-quality theory, and provide implications for the fertility policy such as the recent Three-Child Policy in China and beyond.
